## Troubleshooting

### Resetting the Environment (Stale Dependencies)

If the guest bootstrap fails due to stale dependencies or a corrupted Nix store
in the persistent volume, you can perform a "hard reset" to clear the cache and
start fresh:

1. **Tear down the container and image (volumes preserved):**
   ```bash
   ./bin/dx-destroy
   ```
2. **Delete and recreate the persistent Nix volume:**
   ```bash
   container volume delete dx-nix
   container volume create dx-nix
   ```
3. **Bring everything back up:**
   ```bash
   ./bin/dx
   ```
   *Note: This will trigger a full download of all Nix packages during the next bootstrap.*

For a complete wipe (including `/persist` contents and SSH keys), use
`./bin/dx-factory-reset` — it prompts for confirmation before removing anything.

### Checking Bootstrap Logs
After a factory reset, `./bin/dx` must repopulate the complete Nix store before
SSH starts. The command waits for the full bounded retry period and prints a
recent bootstrap log line every 30 seconds. To monitor the complete bootstrap
output from another terminal:
```bash
container logs dx-host -f
```
